# Hybrid Multicloud
is a computing environment that connects an organization's on-premise private cloud and third-party public cloud into a single infrastructure for running the organization's applications.

## Multi-Cloud
Multi-cloud is a cloud adoption strategy that embraces a mix of cloud models from different service providers, public, private, and managed, across infrastructure, platform, or software services.

## Microservices
Microservices architecture is an approach in which a single application is composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components or services.
These services typically have their own stack running on their own containers. 
They communicate with one another over a combination of APIs, event streaming, and message brokers.

## Serverless Computing
Serverless is an approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks such as scaling, scheduling, patching, and provisioning application stacks to cloud providers allowing developers to focus their time and effort on the code and business logic specific to their applications or process.
The serverless computing environment allocates resources as needed for the applications.

### Key characteristics 
- Pay as you use.
- Abstracts the infrastructure away from developers.
- Code executes as individual functions.
- No prior execution context is required.

### Latest serverless computing services
- IBM Cloud
- AWS Lambda 
- Microsoft Azure

## Cloud Native Applications
A cloud-native application consists of microservices working together as a whole to comprise an application,
yet each can be independently scaled and iterated
through automation and orchestration processes.
It is simply an application developed to run on cloud infrastructure or existing applications are re-engineered with cloud-native principles.

## DevOps
DevOps is an approach that fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, streamlining the entire software delivery lifecycle. By promoting a culture of collaboration, automation, and continuous feedback, DevOps enables organizations to deliver software products more efficiently and reliably.

## Application modernization
Application modernization helps organizations accelerate their digital transformation, take advantage of new technologies and services, and become more responsive to changing market dynamics. Cloud computing is one of the key enablers of application modernization.
