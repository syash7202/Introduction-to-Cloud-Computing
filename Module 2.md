# IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
- IaaS cloud provider manages the physical resources: Data Centers, Cooling, power, Networking and security, Servers, and storage.
- PaaS cloud provider manages the platform infrastructure:  operating System, Development tools, Databases, and Business analytics.
- SaaS cloud provider hosts & manages: Applications and Data

# Infrastructure as a Service 
is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental computing, network, and storage.
The cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.
In an IaaS Cloud environment, customers can create or provision virtual machines (or VMs) in their choice of Region and Zone available from the Cloud Provider.
These VMs typically come pre-installed with the customer’s choice of operating system. The customers can then deploy middleware, install applications, and run workloads on these VMs.
They can also create storage for their workloads and backups.
Cloud providers often provide customers the ability to track and monitor the performance

## Use cases of IaaS 
- Test & Development
- Business Continuity and disaster recovery
- High-performance computing
- Big data analysis

## IaaS Concerns
- lack of transparency 
- dependency on a third party

# Platform as a Service
is a cloud computing model that provides customers with a complete platform to develop, deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third party.
The PaaS provider hosts everything: servers, networks, storage, operating system, application runtimes, APIs, middleware,
databases and other tools at their data center.
The provider also takes responsibility for the installation, configuration, and operation of the application infrastructure, leaving the user responsible for only the application code and its maintenance.
Customers pay for this service on a usage basis and purchase resources on demand.

## Use cases of PaaS
- API development and management.
- Internet of Things
- Business analytics, or intelligence
- Business Process management
- Master data management

## Adavantages of PaaS
- Scalability  
- Faster time to market
- Greater agility & innovation

## Risks of PaaS
- Information security threats
- Dependency on the service provider's infrastructure
- Customers lack control over changes in strategy, service offerings, or tools.

# Software as a Service
is a cloud offering that provides users with access
to a service provider’s cloud-based software.  aaS providers maintain the servers, databases, and code that constitute an application.
They also manage access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. Applications reside on a remote cloud network,
and users use these applications without having to maintain and update the infrastructure.

## Key Characteristics
- Multitenant Architectures: managed centrally and used by end users.
- Manages privileges & monitors data
- Security, Compliance, Maintenance
- Custom Applications
- Subscription model
- Scalable resources

## Use Cases
- Reduces on-premises IT infrastructure & capital expenditure.
- Avoid ongoing upgrades, Maintenance & patching
- Run applications with minimal input
- Manage websites, marketing, sales & operations

## Concers for Saas
- Data Ownership & data safety 
- Third-party maintains business-critical data
- Needs a good network connection

# Deployment model
indicates :
- where the model resides
- who owns & manages it
- how cloud resources & services are made available to users.

**4 cloud models are:** 
1. Public Cloud
2. Private Cloud
3. Community Cloud
4. Hybrid cloud

## Private Cloud Model

## Benefits
- On-demand resources 
- The most significant economics of the sale
- Highly available 

## Concerns
- Security: data breaches, loss, account hijacking & more.
- Data sovereignty compliance 

## Private Cloud Model
- exclusively used by a single organization with multiple consumers.
- Owned, Managed & operated by an organization, third party, or combination
- May exist on or off premises.
- Can be set as **INTERNAL or EXTERNAL** 
-> Internal : on-premises; owned & managed by organization.
-> External : owned, managed & operated by service provider.

## Benefits 
- Controlled by internal IT
- Reduced costs
- Better scalability
- Controlled access & security 
- Greater agility

## Hybrid Cloud Model
Connects an organization's on-premise private cloud  & third-party public cloud. 
It gives : 
- Flexibility
- workloads move freely
- Leverage public & private clouds with "cloud bursting"

## Three Tenets 
- Interoperable: public & private cloud understands each other's APIs, configurations, data formats, authentications & authorization.
- Scalable: Private clouds can leverage public cloud capacity
- Portable: Move applications & data between on-premise, cloud systems, & cloud service providers.

# Cloud Community
“Cloud infrastructure [that] is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.”

In the community cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for use by a community of organizations with shared concerns. One or more of the organizations in the community, a third-party provider, or both are responsible for the ownership, management, and operation of this infrastructure.
