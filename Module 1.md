# Virtual Machines
- multiple distinct computer environments exist on the same physical hardware,
- Each VM --> guest OS --> memory, CPU & hard drives --> shared resources.

# Virtualisation
- shared hosting environments
- virtual private servers
- virtual dedicated servers

# Hypervisor
A hypervisor also separates the Virtual Machines logically, assigning each slice of the underlying computing power, memory, and storage, preventing the virtual machines from interfering with each other.

    - Pre-built tools
    - Keep data secure
- Efficiency
    - Get to market quicklt
    - Accessible from anywhere
    - Backedup on network
- Staregic value
    - Provides innovative techonologies
    - Manges underlying infrasturcture

# Challenges of Cloud adoption
- Data security, associated with loss or unavailability
- Governance and sovereignty issue
- Legal, regulatory, and compliance issues
- Partnering with the right cloud service providers
- Business continuity and disaster recovery

# Blockchain & Cloud
- Blockchain : A secure, immutable network that allows only members to view only the transactions that are relevant to them.
